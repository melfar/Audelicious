## Installation

 * Install and setup [scratchbox](http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/Maemo_5_SDK_installation_for_beginners)

 * Download [fftw3](http://www.fftw.org/download.html) (build-time dependency) and install to /usr:

(on your desktop:)
    wget http://www.fftw.org/fftw-3.2.2.tar.gz
    tar xzf fftw-3.2.2.tar.gz && cd fftw-3.2.2

(in scratchbox dev environment:)
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make && make install

 * You need [Qt 4.6](http://qt.nokia.com/products/platform/maemo) installed in scratchbox to proceed.
 
   `qmake && make`
   
 * Copy `AudeliciousQT` file to the device, make sure you have *Qt 4.6* installed on the device.  If you have both *4.5* and *4.6*, move *4.5* away from `/usr/lib` to a temporary directory and set env `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to *qt4.6* directory.  *NOTE*: you won't need to worry about it on *PR 1.2* :)
 
 * run `./AudeliciousQT` from the terminal or install `.desktop` file to application manager.  Enjoy!
